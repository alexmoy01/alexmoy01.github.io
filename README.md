# Alex Moy – Electrical Engineering Portfolio

Hi there! I'm **Alex Moy**, an Electrical Engineering student at Tufts University (Class of 2026).  
I’m passionate about **embedded systems, PCB design, circuit debugging, and signal processing**.  
I enjoy building end-to-end hardware/software solutions — from schematics and PCB layout to firmware and system testing.
