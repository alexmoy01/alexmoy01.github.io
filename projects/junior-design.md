# Project Overview
In this project, we designed and built a small robotic vehicle capable of autonomously navigating a test track by following colored lanes.  
The system integrates multiple components:
- Arduino Uno  
- Motor control (H-Bridge)  
- Color sensing circuit  
- Obstacle detection circuit  
- Battery monitoring  

This project emphasized the full engineering design process: ideation, prototyping, iterative testing, refinement, and client-oriented communication.

## Bot Specifications
The bot consists of an Arduino Uno, multiple sensor circuits, and a custom acrylic chassis that holds all components together.

## Motor and H-Bridge
We used an **L293D H-Bridge IC** to control two DC motors.  
- Logic voltage vs motor voltage separation  
- Enable pins for control  
- Arduino inputs (3 per side → left & right motors)  
- Forward, reverse, start, and stop functionality

## Color Sensing Circuit
- Sensor: **CSS001-8001 Photocell**  
- Illumination: Blue & Red LEDs toggled by Arduino  
- Output: Voltage variation read on **A2**  
- Arduino pin 13 → Blue LED, pin 12 → Red LED

## 🛠️ Chassis
- Designed in **Onshape**  
- Fabricated with **laser-cut acrylic** at Nolop  
- Mounts for motors, OmniBall, and electronics  
- Velcro mounting for flexible circuit placement  
- Wire routing hole for a cleaner, professional look

## Obstacle Detection Circuit
- IR emitter: **LVIR3333 LED**  
- Detector: **SFH 203 FA photodiode (900nm)**  
- Output amplified with resistor network  
- Output → **A4** on Arduino

## Customer Response
We focused on:  
- **Battery usability** → intuitive LED system  
- **Clean design** → hidden wiring, neat chassis  
- **Security** → server communication restricted to trusted IDs
